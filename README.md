    <img src="assets/images/colour-palette.png">

  - #### Typography

    - The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    - Additional typography will include Source Sans Pro as a nice pairing for Montserrat recommended [here](https://www.figma.com/google-fonts/montserrat-font-pairings/). It is a modern sans-serif font that provides a minimalist and readable text.
    - An additiona font of Merriweather from Google fonts will be used for small and copyright text - a clean modern serif font maintaining class and readability.

  - #### Imagery

    - Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.
    - The image of the technician provides a face, building trust between the user and the site owner
    - Stock images are used for the services provided to ensure high quality, professional appearance. Again reinforcing trust between user and owner.

  - #### Interaction Feedback
    - Accent colours are used upon interaction such as hover and click to provide feedback to the user that they are interacting with an element, and that the element serves a purpose. Examples include button hover changing from the primary #eab29d to a deeper #e6a288 and the nav items changing from a light grey to a dark grey.
